CSS: Cascading Style Sheet

syntax is:

<name of the element> {
	<styles>:<value>;	
}

*not having a closing tag for style would break the page

Q. How many ways can css/styles be integrated into a html?
Ans: there are three ways you can write a css:
1. attribute/inline - most preferred way 
ex: <body style="<style>:<value>;<style>:<value>;"> </body>

2. internal - less preferred way
ex: 
<style>
	<name of the element> {
		<style>:<value>;
	}
</style>

3. external - least preferred way
ex: <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
the syntax for internal and external styels is same

browsers understand only RGB (Red Green and Blue) colors
0to255.com to create a color
all colors can be represented by a hexadecimal number #******

styles: 
border:<width> <type> <color>;, order of the properties wont
matter but used/standard convention is as above

or use individually 
border-style
border-color
border-image
border-width etc.

display: change display nature of the element/tag
an element can be displayed:
1. inline
2. block
3. inline-block
4. table
5. flex - not used often
6. none - do not display the element at all
a block level element can have inline elements but not the
other way around which will cause the stylesheet to break.

in css the comment is /* */, and important comments can be 
represented by "TODO:".

we can capture an id by using # as a prefix, ex:
<button type="reset" id="reset"></button>
#reset {}

we can also capture using type or name:
button [type="reset"] {}
button [name="reset"] {}

every element in html has a background. the styles to background
are similar to border
