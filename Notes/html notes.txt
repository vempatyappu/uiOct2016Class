HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language : is used by browser to determine how and what to render the data downloaded from server/tunnel

*the browser will not render a page until all the files are downloaded, which takes millisecs
< : delimiter
<"..."> : "..." is called an element

the browser always looks for index.html file in the downloaded files, and its rendered line by line by the browser

Structure of a html:
all html shld have the first line mentioning the tyoe of html its using for the page
<!doctype html> for html 5

Then its followed by <html> element and closed with </html>.
Every <html> element has a <head> and a <body> elements.

*Always use indentation to make your code readable and clean.
*All elements shld be closed <...> </...> else the browser will try to keep rendering it and eventually crash.

Advantages of HTML5:
1. it introduced new elements like <video>, <audio>, <section> etc.
2. it introduced the concept of semantic html 
3. it introduced the concept of media
4. it introduced the concept of storages
*google for more features of HTML5

Q. Why do we have to use HTML5 instead of HTML4?
Ans: As HTML4 requires accessing a syntax file on w3.org to check for syntax everytime a page is rendered making it slower than HTML5

*garbage rendering is called "quirks mode" in browsers language.

browsers interpret elements two ways:
1. block level element : has dimensions, can also forcefully set dimensions
ex : 
	1. body
	2. div: short for divisons
	3. section, article, header, footer etc.
2. inline level element : doesnt have dimensions/adopts dimensions from child elements
ex:
	1. span
	2. ank
	3. image blocks

*in HTML5 a new concept was introduced called "trinity" (this is slang and wont be found on the web)
Trinity means every page must contain three elements: header, body and footer
Every element shld be a child of <article> inside which you shld have <header> <section> (used instead of body) and <footer>
In the body this is always the hierarchy and the below trinity shld always be used and can be nested as many times
<article>
	<header></header>
	<section>
		<article>
			<header></header>
			<section></section>
			<footer></footer>
		</article>
	</section>
	<footer></footer>
</article>

*in HTML every element can be repeated other than head and body
*entire website shld be in the trinity format

element <nav> : the navigation bar, in most cases its in the <header>
a <nav> can have a heading

element <h1>, <h2> ..: heading element and the number beside h denotes the size of the heading with h1 being the biggest size
heading can be in <nav> or <header>.

*in html there are two ways of having lists
1. unordered list
2. ordered list

element <ul> : unordered list
element <ol> : ordered list
element <li> : list item
the elements <ul> and <ol> can have only one child element and that is <li>.
