HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language : is used by browser to determine how and what to render the data 
downloaded from server/tunnel

*the browser will not render a page until all the files are downloaded, which takes millisecs
< : delimiter
<"..."> : "..." is called an element

the browser always looks for index.html file in the downloaded files, and its rendered line by line 
by the browser

Structure of a html:
all html shld have the first line mentioning the tyoe of html its using for the page
<!doctype html> for html 5

Then its followed by <html> element and closed with </html>.
Every <html> element has a <head> and a <body> elements.

*Always use indentation to make your code readable and clean.
*All elements shld be closed <...> </...> else the browser will try to keep rendering it and 
eventually crash.

Advantages of HTML5:
1. it introduced new elements like <video>, <audio>, <section> etc.
2. it introduced the concept of semantic html 
3. it introduced the concept of media
4. it introduced the concept of storages
*google for more features of HTML5

Q. Why do we have to use HTML5 instead of HTML4?
Ans: As HTML4 requires accessing a syntax file on w3.org to check for syntax everytime a page is 
rendered making it slower than HTML5

*garbage rendering is called "quirks mode" in browsers language.

browsers interpret elements two ways:
1. block level element : has dimensions, can also forcefully set dimensions
ex : 
	1. body
	2. div: short for divisons
	3. section, article, header, footer etc.
2. inline level element : doesnt have dimensions/adopts dimensions from child elements
ex:
	1. span
	2. ank
	3. image blocks

*in HTML5 a new concept was introduced called "trinity" (this is slang and wont be found on the web)
Trinity means every page must contain three elements: header, body and footer
Every element shld be a child of <article> inside which you shld have <header> <section> 
(used instead of body) and <footer>
In the body this is always the hierarchy and the below trinity shld always be used and can be 
nested as many times

<article>
	<header></header>
	<section>
		<article>
			<header></header>
			<section></section>
			<footer></footer>
		</article>
	</section>
	<footer></footer>
</article>
the reason trinity is used even if header and footer can be empty is to keep your code clean.

*in HTML every element can be repeated other than head and body
*entire website shld be in the trinity format

element <nav> : the navigation bar, in most cases its in the <header>
a <nav> can have a heading, usually <nav> is in header/footer

element <h1>, <h2> ..: heading element and the number beside h denotes the size of the heading 
with h1 being the biggest size
heading can be in <nav> or <header>.

*in html there are two ways of having lists
1. unordered list
2. ordered list

element <ul> : unordered list, bullets
element <ol> : ordered list, ordered with numbers
element <li> : list item
the elements <ul> and <ol> can have only one child element and that is <li>.

Q. What is semantic html?
Ans: Semantic HTML was introduced in HTML5. It's a way of making us developers understand what 
an elements function is.
Its a structured way of writing a html code thats understandable by a different developer.

attribute: an attribute in html basically describes its characteristics
there are several attributes available for each element but few are standard for all elements:
1. id: describes uniqueness of an element
2. class: shares common values b/w elements

*for commenting <!-- --> shld be used, commonly used for helpful tips to others working on the 
same file
The message is usually left before an element. To make a comment important use 
TODO: after <!-- like <!-- TODO: -->

two main components with which html gets rendered by the browser:
1. tag: a tag has closing tag name. ex: <head></head>
2. element: elements are fields which accept some sort of inputs. they dont have closing fields
ex: <input />
every element has a mandatory attribute to be added.

all attribute values shld not have spaces
newLicenseForm - this type of casing is called camel casing in programming language, first 
letter of each word is capitalized

*every input field must have an id attribute and a name attribute
*a form shld have atleast an input and a button, and input is absolutely necessary

element <span>: used to show small one line statements

element <head>: is needed as it holds all the meta data, meta data is nothing but information 
about data and everything in head is not visible on the page.
the info in the head is used by search engines to find the keywords or info about the webpage

*a thumb rule is that whatever tags and elements allowed in body are not allowed in head and viceversa

the tags allowed in <head> are:
1. <title>: Set the title of the page to be displayed on the tab of the webpage
2. <style>: used to set css style on html file itself
3. <script>: used to write javaScript on the html file itself
and the elements:
1. <link/>: link is used to link an external source - like external image or css files, 
needs two attributes always:
	a. rel: to specify relation b/w your file and external source
	b. href: source address, url or local
also used to link fevicons to the page
2. <base/>: defines the base url for our website. once a webpage and all its related files are 
ready and loaded onto the server the base directs the browser to the server's ip address. 
has href attribute defining the servers url
3. <meta/>: 

fevicons: the little icons displayed on the tab of a webpage

Q. for a HTML code why is the <head> before the <body>?
Ans: bcos there are certain meta data like link which grabs an external file that needs to be
executed before the webpage renders
