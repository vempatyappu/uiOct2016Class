        This assignment is to test hyperlinks in page and outside.
        This is a simple paragraph that is meant to be nice and easy to type which is why there will be mommas no
        periods or any capital letters so i guess this means that it cannot really be considered a paragraph but just a
        series of run on sentences this should help you get faster at typing as im trying not to use too many difficult
        words in it although i think that i might start making it hard by including some more difficult letters I'm
        typing pretty quickly so forgive me for any mistakes i think that i will not just tell you a story about the
        time i went to the zoo and found a monkey and a fox playing together they were so cute and i think that they
        were not supposed to be in the same cage but they somehow were and i loved watching them horse.

        The metal porch swing virtually sizzled on the old wooden front porch today. But we sat there anyway. Gramma
        wouldn’t hear of anything else. I suggested a walk through the forest, hoping to entertain a breeze or two and
        to take advantage of the shade. Gramma shook her head. You were supposed to sit on the porch after supper,
        and that’s what we were going to do.

        Decades before you experienced websites which create custom radio stations by tailoring your musical selections
        according to your likes and dislikes, a pioneering researcher had the same concept. Although he is known now
        primarily among music historians, it is entirely possible that such sophisticated computer programs would not
        exist without the work of Alan Lomax.
